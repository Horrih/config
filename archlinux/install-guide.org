* Refind

Start by installing the refind package, then run refind install.

However, be careful : your kernel options are not properly generated when booting from the
live USB, you'll need  to edit them yourself.

Here is an example of working config

#+begin_src bash
cat /boot/refind_linux.conf
"Boot with standard options"  "root=UUID=e95ec57e-0410-422c-9705-3ca5cbe992a0 rw rootflags=subvol=@"
"Boot to single-user mode"    "root=UUID=e95ec57e-0410-422c-9705-3ca5cbe992a0 rw rootflags=subvol=@ single"
"Boot with minimal options"   "ro root=/dev/nvme0n1p3"

#+end_src

The UUID can be found with the following command

#+begin_src bash
  blkid /dev/nvme0n1p3
#+end_src

That's enough, your kernel will be auto detected !
